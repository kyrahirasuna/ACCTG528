A typical starter programming exercise is to display hellow world on the screen, we will prompt Chat GPT to provide us with something a bit more interactive but along the same lines.

Example prompt:
I need detailed guidance on developing a Python application that displays "Hello World" in ten different languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Arabic, Portuguese, and Hindi). The app should feature a resizable user interface using Tkinter, with ten buttons, each labeled with a different language. When a button is clicked, the message on the display should update to "Hello World" in the selected language. The GUI should be visually appealing with a color scheme of different shades of purple.

Please provide step-by-step instructions on:

Setting up the basic GUI structure with Tkinter, ensuring the window is resizable.
Handling button events to update the display with the "Hello World" message in the correct language.
Importing and using appropriate Python modules to ensure that non-Latin scripts are correctly displayed and handled.
Include ample beginner-friendly comments in the code to explain each step and function. The code should be structured in a way that allows easy expansion for adding more languages or features in the future.

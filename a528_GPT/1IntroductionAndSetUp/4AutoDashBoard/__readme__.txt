This will be the ending challenge for this class. Work on creating a dashboard in python to display summary information about the transactions you created in exercise 3 of this class. Remember to prompt Chat GPT using a detailed prompt, and use debugging or reprompting until the code produces what you are looking for. As we work through these exercises, remember that the goal for Class 2 "Individual Challenge" is to assess the usefulness of LLMs to generate code to automate various tasks.
